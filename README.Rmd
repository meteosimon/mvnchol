[**BAMLSS**](http://www.bamlss.org/) families for
[multivariate Gaussion regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.13518)
models. The multivariate Gaussian distribution is
reparameterized using the (modified) Cholesky
decomposition of the covariance matrix.

## Installation

This package is hosted on the gitlab server of the Universitaet
Innsbruck. The repository has public access.

* You can either install it directly on your system by
    using [**remotes**](https://remotes.r-lib.org/) or
	[**devtools**](https://devtools.r-lib.org/) in an R session:

```r
remotes::install_git("https://git.uibk.ac.at/c4031039/mvnchol")
```

* Or clone it using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and a git client for your system.
    And build and INSTALL it after cloning, e.g. in a bash:

```bash
git clone https://git.uibk.ac.at/c4031039/mvnchol.git
R CMD build mvnchol
R CMD INSTALL mvnchol_0.2.0.tar.gz
```

* Or download the source code as tarball
[mvnchol-master.tar.gz](https://git.uibk.ac.at/c4031039/mvnchol/-/archive/master/mvnchol-master.tar.gz).
Here, you also have to build and INSTALL the package after the download.

## First Model

```{r}
library(bamlss)
library(mvnchol)
data(simdata)
d <- simdata$d
f <- make_formula(y1 | y2 | y3 ~ s(x) | s(x) | s(x))
b <- bamlss(f, family = mvnchol_bamlss(k = 3), data = d)
plot(b, model = "lambda12")
```
